## Real Time Crypto Prices ##

We provide real-time crypto prices so your visitors stay informed of the latest price movements in the world of crypto-currencies.

If you run a finance or crypto-related website, this will be a very useful tool to offer your visitors and prolong their time spent on your site.

## Monetize your traffic elegantly by adding affiliate links ##

Most of the large and reputable crypto exchanges offer affiliate programs when you send them users which then open accounts and / or start trading. 

Our shortcode is an extremely elegant and sublime way to monetize this traffic. This is a great way to expand your website earnings.

## It works! ##

We are using this shortcode on our own finance platform successfully since a long time. It is the highest converting tool we have ever implemented, despite having banners, widgets and other items as well.

This is why we want to share it with the whole world now. 

## All languages possible ##

Why? Because you can fully customize the text of the "Buy" button in the backend. This ensures optimal conversion rates, no matter from which country your visitors are. 

## Swift and Easy Integration ##

Simply add a brief shortcode to your page or post. The content will appear on the frontend then. The shortcode is as follows:

Insert [kvp_shortcode] into your page or post and the price bars will appear in the frontend.
